https://public.researchspace.org/resource/?uri=http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/person-institution/15159 ,Virabhadra ,male ,"The origin of the warrior poses, Virabhadrasana I, II and III is derived from an ancient story of Lord Shiva. The warrior poses illustrate an incident that occurred in the celestial realms in a timeless time long ago. This is a story of love, attachment, pride, shame, vengeance, violence, sadness, compassion and renunciation. The whole gamut of emotions can be found in this tale of pride and transformation. 

Lord Shiva was married to his beloved Sati and lived in the pleasure city, Bhoga which he had created. Sati's father Daksha had never approved of his daughter's marriage. To Daksha, Shiva was an unorthodox hermit, who frequented cremation grounds. No yogi with long matted hair, who consumes intoxicants, sings and dances whenever he pleases, was a worthy husband for his daughter. Daksa the Prajapati (the worldly creator), was the upholder of civilization, he thrived on rules and regulations. Shiva was his antithesis. 

Shortly after Sati had left her secure home with her father to live with Shiva, Daksa organized a great party, a yagna or ritual sacrifice. He invited all the members of the entire heavenly universe, all that is except Shiva and Sati. Sati got word of this and suggested to Shiva that they go anyway. Shiva said, Why go, were we are not invited? I do not wish to incite your father's anger any more than I have already. Sati was hurt by her father's refusal to acknowledge her marriage and her husband; she decided to go alone to the party. 

When she arrived her father asked her why she was there, as she was not invited. Her father, sniggering, said Perhaps you have come to your senses and have had it with your wild animal of a husband, isn't he also called Lord of the Beasts? All the guests present laughed. Sati defending her husband spoke, He is one with nature and does not seek to control animals by bending them to his will. Society is artificial and exploits nature. This dialogue between father and daughter entertained the guests. Sati was saddened and humiliated by this public argument with her father. When her father tried to taunt her again she remained silent, letting go of all desire to continue to argue with her father in hopes of defending her husband. She trembled with disgust and indignation at having been so cruelly let down by the one man upon whom she, as a daughter, should always be able to rely. Instead she made an internal resolve to relinquish all family ties. She summoned up her strength and spoke this vow to her father, Since you have given me this body I no longer wish to be associated with it. She walked past her father and sat in a meditative seat on the ground. Closing her eyes, envisioning her true Lord, Sati fell into a mystic trance. Going deep within herself she began to increase her own inner fire through yogic exercises until her body burst into flames. 

When news of Sati's death reached Shiva, he was first shocked and saddened, then enraged. He fell into the deepest and darkest place he could find. He tore his hair out, and fashioned from this hair the fiercest of warriors, Siva named this warrior, Virabhadra. Vira (hero)+ Bhadra (friend). He commanded Virabhadra to go to the yagna and destroy Daksha and all guests assembled. Virabhradra arrives at the party, with sword in both hands, thrusting his way up through the earth from deep underground; this is the first aspect (Virabhadrasana I.) Establishing his arrival for all to see he then sites his opponent, Daksha, (Virabradhasana II.) Moving swiftly and precisely, he takes his sword and cuts off Daksha's head, (Virabadrasana III.) 

Shiva arrives at Daksha's place to see the damage that Virabhadra had ravaged. After this vengeful action, Shiva absorbs Virabhadra back into his own form and then Siva becomes known as Hare, the ravisher. His anger is gone but now he is filled with sorrow. This sorrow turns to compassion when he sees the aftermath; the bloody work of Virabhradra. Shiva finds Daksha's headless body and giving it the head of a goat, brings Daksha back to life. Overwhelmed by this generous gesture Daksha calls Shiva, Shankar, the kind and benevolent one. With Daksha's pride put in check he bows in awe and humility to Shiva Shankar. The other gods and goddesses follow his lead and honor Shiva. 

The fact still remained; Sati was dead. Shiva walked away from the scene of the party, carrying the lifeless body of his beloved wife, wandering to where he did not know. But one thing he was sure of; he would find the most isolated place possible and once again become the ascetic recluse. ",Hindu ,

https://public.researchspace.org/resource/?uri=http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/person-institution/236012 ,Great Goddess of Cyprus ,female ,"The term 'Great Goddess of Cyprus' (see also 'Great God of Cyprus') is used by scholars working on Cyprus to refer to the diverse representations of a female deity found on the island during the first mllennium BC. These may depict a single but multi-facted religious personality whose iconography changed according to function (warfare, civic protection, sex, fertility, nature) or specific cult place around the island (at places such as Palaepaphos, Amathus, Kition, Salamis). 



These representations often draw on the imagery of deities in surrounding cultures - especially the Aegean, Syria, and Egypt - but do not necessarily imply the practice of these cults on Cyprus, especially in the absence of inscriptional evidence to name the divinity being worshipped or of literary evidence pointing to the reception of their myths and rituals on Cyprus. For example, the imagery of the Egyptian goddess Hathor was adapted to represent the local goddess who served similar multiple functions: especially sex, fertility, warfare, and copper mining, but there is no evidence that the Egyptian deity was ever honoured directly in Cyprus. Likewise, the familiar iconography of Greek Artemis was grafted onto a/the local goddess of the countryside who, along with a male god (depicted as Bes or as a combination of Herkales and Reshef or sometimes as Pan), served a similar religious function (See 'Great God of Cyprus').  

 

Locally-occurring terms for the Great Goddess are generic - Thea (Goddess), Wanassa (Lady or Queen), Golgia (Goddess of Golgoi) or Paphia (Goddess of Paphos) - and it is not certain whether this reflects a pious reluctance to mention the deity's actual name or points to an overarching concept of a female divinity that suffused all things. Some titles may be specific to a region or even a sanctuary, in the same way as certain iconographic types varied from one part of the island to another - though this variety may also be a reflection of local workshops of stone and terracotta cult images.  



The title 'Paphia' is also an epithet of the Greek Goddess Aphrodite who in Greek literary texts from around 700 BC onwards is associated with Paphos, though her name is not mentioned in any local Cypriot inscription until around 300 BC. It is likely that assimilation of local and foriegn cult occured gradually however, as inscriptions from the fourth century BC onwards in particular name familiar Greek and Phoenician deities (such Apollo paired with Reshef). Only in the Hellenistic period, when Cyprus was ruled by a Greek dynasty based in Egypt, were Greek deities widely mentioned in inscriptions, though they sometimes refer to local adaptations of these cults. At Amathus, Aphrodite is referred to in one inscription as a goddess of agriculture, more akin to Demeter, and this is probably a function previously carried out by the 'Great Goddess' of the city. The deified Ptolemaic queen Arsinoe was associated with Isis in Egypt and with both Isis and Aphrodite in Cyprus, and it is likely that the local Great Goddess/Aphrodite personality was cultivated by the Ptolemies to bolster their control of the island. 



It remains possible that the diverse representations and cults attested on the island reflect a number of religious personalities and concepts, as found in surrounding regions. Cypriot specialists tend to stress a single entity, one that perhaps stems from prehistoric times but which evolved over time in tandem with Cyprus' external contacts and internal developments. The same can be said of the 'Great God of Cyprus' (q.v.). ",Cypriot ,
https://public.researchspace.org/resource/?uri=http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/person-institution/236142 ,Great God of Cyprus ,male ,"The term 'Great God of Cyprus' (see also 'Great Goddess of Cyprus') refers to the diverse cults and representations of a male deity found on the island during the first millennium BC. These may depict a single but multi-facted religious personality whose iconography changed according to function (warfare, hunting, civic protection, fertility) or specific cult places (such as Amathus, Idalion, Kition, or Salamis, &c). These representations often draw on the imagery of deities in surrounding cultures - especially the Aegean, Syria, and Egypt - but do not necessarily imply the practice of these specific cults on Cyprus, especially in the absence of inscriptional evidence to name the divinity being worshipped or of literary evidence pointing to myths and rituals. 

For example, the imagery of the Egyptian Bes (q.v.) was adapted to represent a local god at Amathus and elsewhere on Cyprus, though in one Phoenician inscription the image is dedicated to the Phoenician god Reshef. At Idalion and other sites in the centre of the island, images of a god wearing a lion-skin or controlling a live example, represent a fusion of Greek Herakles (q.v.) and Phoenician Reshef (q.v.). The few accompanying inscriptions mention Greek Apollo (q.v.) and Phoenician Reshef, both gods of hunting and the countryside, but these are probably later assimilations with a local cult figure whom some scholars have termed simply ‘The Master of the Animals’ or ‘Master of the Lion’ (see Counts 2008), stressing the primacy of the image rather than any specific cult name. Images of Greek Pan (q.v.) are also popular, and may have displaced the ‘Master of the Animals’, but like Bes these are subject to local modifications over time, again suggesting a local deity rather than an entirely new cult. Finally, the syncretic Zeus-Ammon (or Hammon) image is also popular in Cyprus during the Cypro-Archaic and Cypro-Classical periods. 

On one fouth-century BC syllabic inscription, the imagery of what may be Apollo or Zeus refers to a ‘Wanax’ (Lord) that may be the male version of the female ‘Wanassa’, a title of the ‘Great Goddess’.  As with the Bes-Reshef correlated mentioned above, both cases indicate that religious imagery was deployed to serve local religious beliefs and ideologies. As with the Great Goddess of Cyprus, only in the Hellenistic period do we see clear evidence for formal introduction of Greek cults with their iconograpies, though here again it is likely that these overlay older cult personalities and practices. The iconography of Dionysos (q.v.) was probably introduced by the ruling Ptolemies, based in Egypt, to bolster their power, but this god of vegetation and the countryside would have blended easily with older cults.

Dakṣa did not like Śiva so excluded him from audience at the ceremony, an insult which so enraged Durgā she flew into a terrible fury. She thus became Kālī, the dark one. Then, as Chinnamastā, she traversed the earth, indiscriminately decapitating all she encountered. She collected the heads and wore them as a trophy around her neck.  Śiva watched in horror as this destruction befell the earth. In order to stop her, he lay down in her path. The most famous image of Kālī shows her stepping on her husband and, in so doing, she fills with shame at defiling her husband's body. At this moment she returns to consciousness as Durgā. In order to dissipate the evil, Śiva cuts up Kālī's body and throws the pieces across the earth. One of them is said to have landed where the famous temple at Kālīghat stands today. ",Hindu ,
